# Week 3: Generating Data to Test a Hypthesis
This week we are going to generate a data set to test our hypothesis. This will include more detailed data collection for analysis than last week's quick test.

At the end of this week you should have a complete data set for the measured critical angle for two different masses.

## Step 1: Set-up a Spreadsheet
Your spreadsheet should allow you to:
1. Record data
2. Plot your data in real time. This is essential to guide choices during data collection. In this case we will plot our data as a histogram.
3. Analyze your data. In this case your goal is to determine the co-efficient of static friction for each mass.

Look back to the spreadsheet you used for your preliminary data collection last week. You will want to organize your data collection in a similar way. These steps will guide you through this process:

1. Take a careful look at the spreadsheet we provided. Think about how it is organized: e.g. division into sections and headings for both sections and data columns. To make the most of your worksheets they need to be organized.
2. Begin by creating a worksheet. This can be a new sheet in your existing worksheet using the add sheet button in the bottom left or a new worksheet.
3. Set up a table to determine the critical angle for the first mass.

    i. Give the table a title.

    ii. Use the borders feature to outline the table.
