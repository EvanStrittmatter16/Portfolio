# Week 1: Exploratory Phase

![Exploratory Phase](images/exploratory-phase.png)

We begin our investigation of measuring $$\mu_s$$ by doing an initial exploration. Our goal is to come up with a hypothesis to test and a plan for how we will do so (an experimental design). In the Exploratory Phase it can be especially important to take detailed notes. Organizing a digital lab notebook can be tricky, so for Module 1 we are providing a [template for you to follow along with in Google Classroom](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7BDmQAXKmmr6LEs95xBj3y0d_Sd-gTzFa5BL0f9xmo/preview).


## Background Reading

Often the first step is to do some background reading and theoretical analysis. [This video from Prof. Saeta](https://youtu.be/EUT0F3k4asc?t=217) on how $$\mu_s$$ and $$\theta_c$$ are related will provide a quick refresher.

In your lab notebook, try the derivation yourself and document the result.

## Formulating a Hypothesis

We can now try to think of a hypothesis we can test with an experiment. As a quick check, according to the theory, which of the following factors will affect a measurement of $$\theta_c$$?

A. the mass of the block $$m$$

B. the composition and structure of the two surfaces of the block and ramp in contact

C. the rate at which the ramp is raised

D. all of the above

E. none of the above

Correct answer: **B** 

According to the theory, the critical angle $$\theta_c$$ only depends on $$\mu_s$$. And since $$\mu_s$$ depends on the two surfaces in contact, we would expect the mass of the block and how quickly the ramp is raised to be unimportant.

Based on this answer, try to come up with some hypotheses you could try to test. The theory makes specific predictions, and you can use those predictions to form the basis of a hypothesis. Post some of your ideas and check out others [at this specific place on Piazza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

**For Module 1 we will all test the same hypothesis.** The hypothesis we will test is:

"The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces as measured by the critical angle of slipping is independent of the mass."

## Final Note

In the diagram at the top of the page, the arrows come full-circle and suggest that we may not be done. Although we have come up with an experimental design, we could return to some background reading to make sure that we are exploring hasn't been done already. We could, for example continue doing background reading to refine our experimental design and hypothesis by [searching Google Scholar for academic articles related to  our topic/hypothesis](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=critical+angle+and+the+coefficient+of+static+friction). The first search result, for example, measured $$\mu_s$$ for lubricated surfaces and found that the measured $$\mu_s$$ might depend on mass based on the type of lubricant. Although this type of hypothesis refinement frequently happens in experimental research, it is beyond the scope of our learning objectives in Physics 50.
