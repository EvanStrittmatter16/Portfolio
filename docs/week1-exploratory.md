We begin our investigation of measuring $$\mu_s$$ by doing an initial exploration. Our goal is to come up with a hypothesis to test and a plan for how we will do so (an experimental design). In the Exploratory Phase it can be especially important to take detailed notes. Organizing a digital lab notebook can be tricky, so for Module 1 we are providing a [template for you to follow along with in Google Classroom](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7BDmQAXKmmr6LEs95xBj3y0d_Sd-gTzFa5BL0f9xmo/preview).



## Background Reading

Often the first step is to do some background reading and theoretical analysis. [This video from Prof. Saeta](https://youtu.be/EUT0F3k4asc?t=217) on how $$\mu_s$$ and $$\theta_c$$ are related will provide a quick refresher.

In your lab notebook, try the derivation yourself and document the result.

## Formulating a Hypothesis

We can now try to think of a hypothesis we can test with an experiment. As a quick check, according to the theory, which of factors will affect a measurement of $$\theta_c$$?

#### Mini-question

Based on this answer, try to come up with some hypotheses you could try to test. The theory makes specific predictions, and you can use those predictions to form the basis of a hypothesis. Post some of your ideas and check out others [on the "Hypotheses" note on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kdyuyniyaz052s?cid=7).

**For Module 1 we will all test the same hypothesis.** The hypothesis we will test is:

"The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces as measured by the critical angle at which an object slips is independent of its mass."

## Instrumentation

Now that we've decided what we hypothesis we are going to test, we need to figure out what equipment and experimental tools we are going to use. For this module, we are going to make use of whatever you have on hand. 

You will need a "block" and a "ramp" (e.g. a hard pencil case on a hardcover textbook) that satisfy the following requirements:

+ both items need to have flat, rigid surfaces
+ when you tilt the ramp, the block needs to slide without rolling or tipping
+ a way to add mass to the block without changing the surfaces in contact between the block and ramp

Share your ideas and check out what others are doing at [Piazza: Instrumentation for Module 1](https://piazza.com/class/kdyuyniyaz052s?cid=8).

To measure the angle we will use your phone or a tablet as the tool. Please go to https://phyphox.org (or to the app store on your device) and download the phyphox app. After downloading, find the "Inclination" tool and test that it works correctly with your phone.

Make note of your equipment in your lab notebook (record keeping is so important) and record any other notes you think might be helpful if someone else was trying to replicate your setup. 

## Exploratory Measurements



#### 1. Perform a Single Measurement

Usually one of the first exploratory steps is to use your equipment to take a single measurement. We want to make sure that our measurement (in this case, $$\theta_c$$) will lead to a reasonable value of the calculated quantity we are trying to obtain ($$\mu_s$$). We also want to get a sense of the resolution of our measurement device and how that will affect the uncertainty measured in the calculated quantity.  

+ Place the block on the ramp and slowly raise the ramp while keeping an eye on the plane inclination measurement on the phyphox app. Record in the spreadsheet the value of the angle you observe just before slipping (in other words, perform a single measurement of $$\theta_c$$).

+ [Read about resolution uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#resolution-uncertainty) ($$\approx$$ 5 minutes) first and then record the resolution uncertainty for the critical angle $\delta_\mathrm{res.} \theta_c$$ in your exploratory observations spreadsheet.

| $$\theta_c$$ (degrees) | $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \theta_c $$ (degrees) |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
 | ...            |   ... |


+ Calculate $$\mu_s$$ from your single measurement of $$\theta_c$$ (using the relationship you derived in the [background reading](#background-reading)). 

*Friendly reminder: don't forget to convert the value of the angle from degrees to radians in your Google Sheet calculation.*

+ Learn how to propagate uncertainties from this video of [Prof. Gerbode explaining how to propagate uncertainty in $$\theta_c$$ to uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$](uncertainty-introduction#propagation-of-uncertainties) (10 minutes) and answer the mini-question about uncertainty propagation on that page. 

+  Calculate the resolution uncertainty in measuring the coefficient of static friction $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s$$ by propagating your uncertainty $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \theta_c$$. Derive any formulas you use in your lab notebook.

| $$\mu_s$$  | $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s $$ |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
 | ...            |   ... |


Comment on whether your measured value is reasonable (e.g. is $$\mu_s$$ within the limits of allowable, i.e. between 0 and infinity?  With a quick google search, is it similar to $$\mu_s$$ for similar surfaces? Is your fractional resolution uncertainty reasonably small (fractional resolution uncertainty $$\equiv \frac{\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s}{\mu_s}$$)?




#### 2. Test Repeatability

Random uncertainty

Systematic uncertainty



#### 3. Perform a preliminary test of the hypothesis


#### 4. Explore other factors



## Designing the Experiment





## Final Note

In the diagram at the top of the page, the arrows come full-circle and suggest that we may not be done. Although we have come up with an experimental design, we could return to some background reading to make sure that we are exploring hasn't been done already. We could, for example continue doing background reading to refine our experimental design and hypothesis by [searching Google Scholar for academic articles related to  our topic/hypothesis](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=critical+angle+and+the+coefficient+of+static+friction). The first search result, for example, measured $$\mu_s$$ for lubricated surfaces and found that the measured $$\mu_s$$ might depend on mass based on the type of lubricant. Although this type of hypothesis refinement frequently happens in experimental research, it is beyond the scope of our learning objectives in Physics 50.
