# Projects before Yale
###### SPHS
[Homework #1](images/Ph174-HW1.pdf){:target="_blank"} Put some images/videos here

## Objectives and Process
Can do this as a one big video with seperate descriptions of each of the minor projects, or have this as another index spliting into different seperate projects in greater details. It might be cool for now but this is something I should reduce in the long term.


# EX: of opening a video (I also want to look into figuring out how to imbed a video in the website so it plays automatically)
