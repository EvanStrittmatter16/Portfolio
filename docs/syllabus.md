## Course Description

Biophysics involves the use of techniques from physics to study and describe living systems. Ideas are borrowed from equilibrium & non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, polymer physics, classical & continuum mechanics, and electrodynamics to probe and describe admittedly complex biological systems. In this course, we will explore how diffusion, flow, and swimming behavior impact biolocomotion as well as biomolecular signaling and detection. We will examine how the size of an organism and its interaction with the environment can have significant consequences for movement. This course will be taught in a seminar format. Students will learn to approach a new research field and develop a coherent understanding based on review articles and original research articles.

## Course Goals

After this course you will be able to:
+ Describe how classical and statistical mechanics have been successfully applied to
biolocomotion
+ Approach a new research field and develop a coherent understanding based on review articles
and original research articles
+ Give a presentation on a primary research article
+ Provide constructive feedback on presentations

## Workload

In this course your workload will consist of:
+ two homework assignments based on material covered in the first two weeks
+ reading your classmates’ journal articles (~ 4-6/week) and keeping an active reading journal
+ preparing two 25-30 minute presentations on topics you select (spaced out over the half-semester)
+ provide feedback to your classmates on their presentations
+ participate in class discussion and ask questions during your classmates’ presentations (each presentation will be followed by a discussion/question period)

## Grading

Grading
Your final grade will be evaluated based on a weighted average of the following:
+ 15% for homework (2 assignments)
+ 30% presentation #1
+ 30% presentation #2
+ 15% active reading journal
+ 10% in-class participation

## Assignments, Submissions and Late Policy

Homework: Submission will be through Gradescope. 

Late policy for homework:
+ Up to 6 hours late: 5%
+ Up to 24 hours late: 10%
+ Up to 48 hours late: 15%
+ Up to 72 hours late: 20%

Presentations:
You will be expected to give two 25-30 minute presentations on scheduled dates. You are also expected to submit a copy of your slides through Gradescope before the start of class on your presentation day.

Active reading journal:
You will be expected to read and keep an active reading journal for each of the papers to be presented by your classmates (2 papers per class period). You may choose the format for the active reading journal, but should submit it through gradescope. The active reading journal is due at the start of each class in which papers will be presented covering all papers to be presented in class. 

Here are some helpful suggestions for keeping an active reading journal:

+ [Active Reading Guidelines](https://www.nda-worc.org/uploaded/Online_Classroom_Teachers/Mrs_Krauss/Readersguidlineskrauss.pdf){:target="_blank"} (this one isn't targetted to STEM papers but conveys important distinctions between an active reading journal and a summary that apply across disciplines)

## Collaboration
You may freely discuss the homework and papers with your classmates, including getting help and advice on your presentation and actively reading papers together. However, the submitted homework and reading journal should be prepared/written up individually.

## Journal Articles
Journal articles are available [here](https://jlarlett.github.io/Ph174/library). A link to the repository of articles is also provided on the course Sakai site. Please note that some journals require you to log in through VPN to access campus journal subscriptions. Step-by-step instructions for connecting to HMC VPN are available [here](https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/vpn/).

# The Writing Center
The Writing Center provides a welcoming virtual space for writers to get feedback on their composition projects, whether written, spoken or visual pieces. Writing Center Consultants are prepared to assist students in any discipline with any stage of the writing process, from developing an idea to polishing a final draft. Even the most accomplished writers benefit from seeking feedback at the writing center. You may schedule an online appointment through their
website, https://www.hmc.edu/learning-programs/writing-center/

## Accommodations

HMC is committed to providing an inclusive learning environment and support for all students. Given our current online learning environment, we recognize that the challenges facing students are different and student accommodation needs may change. Students with a disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions) who may need some
accommodation in order to fully participate in this class are encouraged to contact Educational
Accessibility Services at ability@g.hmc.edu to request accommodations. Students from the
other Claremont Colleges should contact their home college's disability resources officer. 

## Wellness

College can be stressful, and it’s important to support the physical and mental well-being of ourselves and others even as we work to learn challenging new material in courses like this one. That means getting some food, sleep, exercise and relaxation even during crunch time! If you find that you are in need of help or overwhelmed by this class, don’t hesitate to reach out to any of the course instructors or the Academic Deans at academicdeans@g.hmc.edu. We will work with you to develop a plan for success in this course.

Please let me know in advance of a missed class if possible, or as soon as you can after the fact. I also know that a variety of events in life can take priority over individual class meetings. If an event in your life, public or private,is creating conflicts with class, please feel free to discuss it with me.

## Belonging

Everyone who is registered for this course belongs here and has valuable contributions to make to our class. Our diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints will enrich the classroom, and our mutual respect will enable us to feel comfortable making mistakes and learning from them.
